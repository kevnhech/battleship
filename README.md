# battleship
Implement the classic game "Battleship" and include TDD in your code.
1. Begin your app by creating the `Ship` class.
2. Create a `Gameboard` class.
3. Create a `Player` class.
4. Import your classes into another file and drive the game using event listeners to interact with your objects. Create a module that helps you manage actions that should happen in the DOM.
5. Finish it up by implementing a system that allows players to place their ships. For example, you can let them type coordinates for each ship or have a button to cycle through random placements.
